Mine2Anki: Smart Subtitles Mining to Build Adaptive Anki Cards

Overview
- What it is: an Ank i add-on that streamlines vocabulary mining from subtitles. It turns lines, phrases, and sentences from video subtitles into targeted, smart flashcards. The system adapts to your current English level, helping you learn faster with cards that match your vocabulary goals.
- Why it matters: many language learners struggle to turn listening practice into effective recall. Mine2anki bridges that gap by extracting frequent or meaningful expressions from subtitles and packaging them into Anki cards that fit your proficiency. The result is a smoother, more personalized study routine that you can run alongside watching your favorite films and shows.
- Core idea: take authentic dialogue from subtitles, surface high-value vocabulary and phrases, generate contextual cards, and schedule them with spaced repetition so you learn what you actually need in real contexts.

What you’ll find in this project
- An add-on for Anki that integrates with your workflow instead of forcing a separate tool.
- A pipeline that processes subtitles, identifies relevant lexical items, and creates well-structured flashcards.
- Configurable learning targets, so you can focus on different goals (everyday vocabulary, business terms, phrasal verbs, etc.).
- A learning system powered by natural language processing (NLP) techniques and spaced repetition scheduling.
- Clear templates for how cards look in Anki, including front-side prompts, example sentences, hints, and audio cues when available.
- A strong emphasis on privacy and local processing. Data you mine from subtitles remains in your local environment unless you choose to export or share.

Why this approach works for language learners
- Real language, real context: subtitles reflect natural speech, idioms, and common collocations you will encounter in real life.
- Level-aware mining: the system estimates your current English level and tunes the difficulty of the generated cards accordingly.
- Contextual learning: examples link back to the source subtitle line, so you can see how a word or phrase works in actual dialogue.
- Efficient repetition: cards are scheduled to maximize retention without overwhelming your study time.

How Mine2Anki works: a high-level view
- Subtitle input: The add-on accepts subtitle inputs from video sources you watch or from files you provide (SRT, VTT, SubRip, and similar formats).
- NLP processing: The system analyzes the text to identify useful vocabulary, phrases, and sentence patterns. It uses simple, robust NLP techniques to surface high-value items such as high-frequency words, collocations, and idioms.
- Context extraction: Each candidate item is linked to its original sentence in the subtitle, so you can study it in context.
- Card templating: For each item, the add-on creates an Anki card with a front prompt, a back explanation, example sentences, and optional audio cues.
- Scheduling and review: Cards are scheduled using a spaced repetition system, tuned to your level and goals. Over time, you revisit items at intervals that maximize retention.
- Local-first design: All processing can run locally by default. You can opt to export data or export decks to share with others, but your core learning experience can remain private to your device.

Architecture and modules
- Subtitle parser: Reads SRT, VTT, and other common subtitle formats. It extracts lines, timestamps, and speaker cues when available.
- Text normalizer: Basic cleanup, normalization, and tokenization to prepare for analysis.
- Vocabulary miner: Identifies candidate words and phrases that are semantically meaningful for learners. It weighs frequency, usefulness, and relevance to your level.
- Phrase detector: Detects collocations and idiomatic expressions that would benefit from example-based learning.
- Card generator: Builds Anki card templates that present the target item, context, synonyms, usage notes, and pronunciation hints when available.
- SRS and deck manager: Interfaces with Anki’s scheduling to determine optimal study intervals and tracks progress across decks.
- Settings and preferences: UI components for adjusting difficulty, target levels, and learning goals.
- Data export and import: Mechanisms to export mined items, lists, or full decks for backup or sharing.

Supported formats and sources
- Subtitle formats: SRT, VTT, SubRip, and related formats are supported for input. The add-on can work with local subtitle files or subtitles embedded within videos when the workflow allows.
- Language targets: You choose the English level granularity you want—beginner, intermediate, or advanced. The mining logic adapts the difficulty accordingly.
- Output format: Cards are created as Anki notes with front/back fields, example sentences, and optional audio attachments. You can customize templates to match your preferred style.

Installation and setup: step-by-step
- Prerequisites:
  - Anki installed on your computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
  - Basic familiarity with using add-ons in Anki.
- Installing Mine2Anki:
  - Open Anki.
  - Go to Tools > Add-ons > Install from file (or Install from URL, depending on your setup) and select the asset you downloaded from the Releases page.
  - If asked, allow permissions for the add-on to read subtitle files and process text.
  - Restart Anki to activate the add-on.
- Post-install configuration:
  - Open the Mine2Anki settings panel.
  - Connect the add-on to your subtitle sources. If you work with local subtitle files, specify their directory or file paths.
  - Choose your target English level. The options typically include levels like A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2, or descriptive bands like beginner, intermediate, and advanced.
  - Set goals: number of new cards per day, types of items to mine (vocabulary vs. phrases), and how aggressively to mine from a given subtitle.
  - Configure card templates: front prompt, back content, example sentence, and audio options.
  - Save the settings and run a test pull to confirm that cards look the way you expect.

Using Mine2Anki in practice: real-world workflows
- Watch, mine, review in a loop:
  - Step 1: Watch a movie or show while subtitles are visible.
  - Step 2: Let the add-on extract high-value words and phrases from the scenes you’re watching.
  - Step 3: Review the newly created cards in your Anki deck. The cards are crafted to connect the target item to its usage in a real sentence.
  - Step 4: Practice with spaced repetition. The system schedules these items to appear at optimal intervals, reinforcing memory while preventing overload.
- How to tailor for your goals:
  - Everyday conversation: mine common everyday words, idioms, and expressions used in casual dialogue.
  - Academic or professional language: pull terms and phrases used in formal contexts or specialized topics.
  - Pronunciation and listening: enable audio fields or TTS cues to help with pronunciation and listening comprehension.
- Sample use-case: learning movie dialogue
  - Choose a favorite film. Extract key phrases from scenes with natural dialogue.
  - Review the cards after you finish the movie. The context sentence helps you recall not just the word but how it is used in conversation.
  - Add your own notes, such as synonyms, example sentences from other contexts, or related collocations.

Card design and templates: how the cards look
- Front side: Prompt that invites recall. Options include:
  - "What does this word mean in the given sentence?"
  - "What is the meaning of this phrase in this context?"
  - "Which word fits best in this sentence?"
- Back side: Explanation and context.
  - Simple definition or sense number.
  - The original subtitle sentence as context.
  - One to two additional example sentences from other sources to reinforce usage.
  - Pronunciation hints (phonetic guidance or audio if available).
- Extra fields:
  - Part of speech
  - Example sentence IDs
  - Opposites or synonyms (optional)
  - Language notes, such as collocations or common prefixes/suffixes
  - Audio support, if you have subtitle audio or TTS assets
- Template examples:
  - Front: “What is the meaning of ‘X’ as used here?”
  - Back: “‘X’ means Y. In this sentence, it describes Z. Common collocations include …”
  - Extra: A second example sentence showing a different usage
- Customization: You can tailor the card layout, font sizes, color schemes, and the amount of information shown on the front vs. back. This helps you align cards with your learning preferences.

Workflow tips for effective learning
- Start simple, then scale: begin with a small daily quota of new cards. Increase gradually as you become comfortable with the workflow.
- Balance to avoid overload: set a cap on new cards per day. It’s better to learn consistently with a steady stream than to overdo it in bursts.
- Use multiple sources: blend subtitles from different genres to diversify vocabulary and phrasing. This helps you recognize words in varied contexts.
- Review timing matters: schedule reviews at times of day when you can focus. If you have a long study session, intersperse new cards with reviews to reinforce memory.
- Leverage context: always look at the original subtitle line. The surrounding text often carries meaning that helps you remember usage better than isolated definitions.

Privacy, data handling, and security
- Local-first processing: the core mining and card generation can run on your machine without sending data to the cloud.
- Optional sharing: if you choose to export decks or data, you can do so via files or shared decks. This enables collaboration or backup without exposing your raw language data by default.
- Minimal data footprint: subtitles, vocabulary items, and card content are stored in the Anki ecosystem, which is designed for personal study data.

Configuration and advanced options
- Level-based filtering: choose a target level to influence which words and phrases are considered high value for mining.
- Frequency thresholds: adjust how often a term must appear in subtitles to qualify for a card.
- Phrase detection: enable or disable detection of common collocations and idioms.
- Card density: control how many items are mined from each subtitle block.
- Audio support: tie in TTS or original audio when available to improve listening practice.
- Export preferences: set default export paths, formats, and naming conventions for decks.

Performance and resource considerations
- Subtitles are typically modest in size, but long videos can generate many potential cards. The add-on is designed to process text efficiently, but very large subtitle collections may require more RAM or longer processing times.
- On mid-range machines, expect responsive behavior during subtitle processing. If you notice slowdowns, try reducing the depth of mining for a given pass or process fewer subtitles at a time.
- Background processing: you can configure the system to mine subtitles during idle moments or after you finish watching, so your study flow remains smooth.

Troubleshooting common scenarios
- Cards not appearing in Anki after mining:
  - Verify the add-on is enabled and properly connected to your Anki profile.
  - Check that the subtitle source is accessible and in a supported format.
  - Ensure you have an active deck selected for mined cards and that the note type matches the template used by the add-on.
- No audio on cards:
  - Confirm audio settings are enabled and that your system has a compatible TTS or audio file source.
  - Check the file paths to any audio assets and ensure they exist if you are using local audio.
- Subtitles with unusual characters:
  - The parser should handle standard Unicode text. If you encounter encoding issues, convert the source subtitles to UTF-8 before mining.
- Performance issues:
  - If processing feels sluggish, reduce the number of items mined per subtitle block or decrease the overall number of subtitles processed in one pass.
  - Verify that you have sufficient RAM for the operation, especially if mining across long video transcripts.

Best practices for teachers, tutors, and language programs
- Structured learning plans: use the add-on to create curated decks for different curricula. For instance, a beginner deck can emphasize high-frequency verbs and basic sentence patterns, while an advanced deck might focus on phrasal verbs and idioms common in daily media.
- Homework and practice: assign daily or weekly mining tasks. Students can mine subtitles from a selected list of videos and bring the resulting cards to class for discussion and practice.
- Progress tracking: leverage Anki’s built-in progress tracking to monitor retention. Look at review counts, interval growth, and lapse rates to adjust teaching strategies.
- Feedback loops: collect student feedback on card usefulness and adjust templates, prompts, and example sentences accordingly.

A deeper dive: the science behind the approach
- The role of frequency in language learning: frequent words and common phrases are learned more quickly when encountered in meaningful contexts. Mine2anki prioritizes items that learners encounter often in subtitles, aligning with the idea that high-utility items should be learned first.
- Contextual learning and recall: memory is strengthened when new information is associated with a real context. By tying each card to the original subtitle sentence, learners can recall both the word and its usage more effectively.
- Spaced repetition and long-term retention: regular, spaced reviews reinforce memory and reduce forgetting. Mine2anki integrates with Anki’s scheduling to optimize review timing based on your performance.
- Idioms and collocations: learning fixed phrases helps learners sound natural and understand subtler shades of meaning. The phrase detector helps surface these units so you can practice them in authentic contexts.

Customization and extensibility
- Card templates: customize the appearance and fields in the cards. If you want to add extra fields like “synonyms” or “example from another source,” you can adjust the template to include them.
- Export and import: export mined items as CSV or JSON for use in other tools or for backup. You can import curated lists into other decks or share with classmates.
- Community-driven templates: the project encourages sharing of card templates that fit different learning styles, such as “short-term memory” templates, “multimodal” templates with audio, or “grammar-focused” templates that emphasize structure.

Accessibility and inclusive design
- Clear prompts: front-side prompts are designed to be direct and easy to understand, reducing cognitive load during recall.
- Visual cues: use of color and simple formatting helps learners quickly parse the card content.
- Audio options: for learners who benefit from listening, audio cues are available when your setup supports it. This helps with pronunciation and listening comprehension.
